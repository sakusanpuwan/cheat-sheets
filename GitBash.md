## **Git**
<img width="200px" alt="git logo" align="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Git-logo-orange.svg">
Git is a version control system (VCS) used to record the completely history of a project. It is installed locally, enabling users to log changes without needing to be connected to the server. Git allows users to roll back their code to previously logged versions. Git repositories can be hosted on GitHub, which allows code to be shared with others - this makes collaboration between team members working on the same software vastly more accessible.

### Connecting to GitHub using SSH
The Secure Shell Protocol, abbreviated as SSH, is a cryptographic protocol used to secure a network connection.

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa <<< y`    generate a public and private key pair

`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pubg`    print the public key to standard output

`ssh -T git@github.com`   test connection

### Rolling Back to Previous Versions using Git
`git revert "7-digit ID"`
- This undoes any of the changes that were committed in the chosen commit.
  - The "7-digit ID" refers to the first 7 digits of the commit ID, which can be found in the log using `git log`.
    - If any changes that were committed after the selected commit include dependencies on the changes being undone, those dependencies will be broken and such that code may no longer work.
    - After using `revert`, a Vim editor will open: exitting this by typing it `:q` then `return` will ensure the revert is confirmed
    - It will show as a commit in the log.

`git reset "7-digit ID"`
- This undoes all changes that were committed **since** the chosen commit
    - This means all commits that were committed after the selected one are also undone.
